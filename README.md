# Overview
Mapty is an interactive web application that allows users to log and track their workouts on a map. Users can add details about their running or cycling workouts, including distance, duration, and, depending on the type of workout, cadence or elevation gain. This project was created for educational purposes, focusing on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, along with the use of the Leaflet library for map-related functionalities.
